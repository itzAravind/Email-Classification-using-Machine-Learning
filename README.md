Email Classification Project
This project aims to employ machine learning algorithms to classify emails as either ham or spam. The dataset used in this project is the Spam Classification Dataset from Kaggle, which contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as either ham (legitimate) or spam.

The project involves the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: This includes cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
Feature Extraction: This involves extracting features from the text data that can be used by the machine learning algorithm.
Model Selection: Several classification algorithms will be evaluated, and the best performing one will be chosen.
Model Training: The chosen algorithm will be trained on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: The trained model will be evaluated on a test set, and its performance will be measured using evaluation metrics.
Deployment: The final model will be deployed, and users will be able to classify emails using the web interface.
Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps that will be applied to the raw text data include:

Removal of stop words and punctuation
Stemming or lemmatization of the remaining words
Converting the text to lowercase
Vectorization of the text data using TF-IDF vectorization
Feature Extraction
For feature extraction, we will be using the TF-IDF vectorization technique. This technique computes the importance of each word in the document based on its frequency in the document and the inverse document frequency (IDF) of the word across the entire corpus.

Model Selection
Several classification algorithms will be evaluated, including:

Naive Bayes
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines
The algorithm that performs the best on the evaluation metrics will be chosen for model training.

Model Training
The chosen algorithm will be trained on the preprocessed data. The trained model will be serialized and saved for later use.

Model Evaluation
The trained model will be evaluated on a test set, and its performance will be measured using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Deployment
The final model will be deployed using a web interface. Users will be able to input email text, and the model will classify it as either ham or spam.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be used to classify emails as either ham or spam. By preprocessing the data, extracting relevant features, selecting the best model, and training and evaluating the model, we can achieve high accuracy in classifying emails.
